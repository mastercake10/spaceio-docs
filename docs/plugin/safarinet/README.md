[SafariNet](https://pluginboard.com/plugin/safarinet) is a **mob catcher plugin** that allows your players to catch and release every mob in the world of Minecraft. It's a nice solution if you want to transport mobs through worlds or even if you want to spawn a certain mob using a dispenser. But, what's the special about this plugin? This plugin works with NBT. That means that this plugin **stores all information** of a mob, things like saddles, horse variant, donkey chests, custom names, hp, villager trades, and armor.


## Features
* 1.8 through 1.21.4 compatibility (updates for newer versions will usually take less than a week)
* Saves the **whole entity data**, including villager trades, chest content in mules, health, sheep color etc.
* Singleuse and reusable eggs
* Customizable SafariNet item (**Modeldata** supported)
* Mob Spawning through dispensers or right clicking
* Configurable **crafting recipes**
* Permission Nodes for Spawn Egg Crafting (Reusable and Single-Use Spawn Eggs)
* Change spawner type with SafariNets
* **Charge** player for catching certain mobs
* Set catching **chances** for certain mobs
* **Customizable lore** for the egg item (Set what should be displayed per entity type in the lore, so villager trades etc. are shown be default)
