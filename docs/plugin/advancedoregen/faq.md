# FAQ
::: details Does this plugin need a skyblock plugin?
Yes it does. The plugin is used to obtain the permssion (or level) of the owner, in order to choose a generator. In a plain vanilla world, there is no way to fetch directly the player permissions mining on the generator. What if two players are mining at one generator, but both have access to different generators?layer mining on a generator, while ignoring the island level (because there isnâ€™t any)
