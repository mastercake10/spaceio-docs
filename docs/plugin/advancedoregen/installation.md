AdvancedOreGen works best along with a supported [SkyBlock plugin](/plugin/customoregen/installation.html#supported-skyblock-plugins).

Without a SkyBlock plugin, AdvancedOreGen would use the permission of the closest player mining on the generator.

Buy and download the [latest version](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advancedoregen.40527/) jar-File and place it into your plugin folder, then restart or reload your server. Keep in mind that you will only see the resource when you have created an account on spigotmc.org.
