The generator can be customized by defining different materials and probabilities.

Its also possible to setup multiple groups or *tiers* of generators that can be unlocked when reaching a certain level or permission.

::: tip
If you're looking for a plugin for configuring the generator in a **GUI** without reloading, you might want to consider the Premium version, [AdvancedOreGen](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advancedoregen.40527/).

It also allows you to use both **permission nodes and island levels**.
