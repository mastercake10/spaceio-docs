# FAQ
::: details Does this plugin need a skyblock plugin? 
It does not essentially need a skyblock plugin, but you will get the best experience with a skyblock plugin. A skyblock plugin is used to obtain the permssion (or level) of the owner, in order to choose a generator. In a plain vanilla world, there is no way to fetch directly the player permissions mining on the generator. So CustomOreGen will just reuse the permission of the closest player mining on a generator, while ignoring the island level (because there isn’t any)

::: details Ores are not generated, why? 
If you’re using Bentobox, verify that the MagicCobblestoneGenerator addon is disabled. If you’re not using Bentobox, check if your skyblock plugin has any in-built oregenerators. If so, ask the developer to add an opt-out option.

::: details Can I use both levels and permission? 
This is not possible in CustomOreGen, but in AdvancedOreGen.
