This guide will assist you in setting up your item sale shop.

This plugin offers a fancy way of selling items to the server. Unlike the default /sell command of Essentials, uShop provides a nice GUI which displays the current worths of any item that were put in the GUI. uShop is a must-have for every survival and skyblock server!
